  Pedro Albizu Campos (1891-1965) was a Puerto Rican attorney and politician, leader of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party and the most prominent figure in the Puerto Rican independence movement of the 20th century.
  
  A graduate of Harvard Law School, Albizu Campos dedicated his life to the struggle for Puerto Rican independence. His political thought combined nationalism with a profound reflection on Latin American cultural identity.
  
  Imprisoned multiple times for his political activism, his writings and speeches remain fundamental to understanding Puerto Rican independence thought.
